# Project Overview 

This project uses YOLOv8 for object detection and segmentation.
The model was trained to detect Cars and Persons in images.

The workflow includes: 

- Preparing a custom dataset
- Annotation using Labellerr
- Training YOLOv8 with segmentation
- Running inference on new test images
- Visualizing predictions
- bytetracking using model

# Dataset 
- Custom dataset with two classes:
  - car
  - person

# Training 
from ultralytics import YOLO 

model = YOLO("yolov8n-seg.pt")

model.train( 
    data="dataset/data.yaml",
    epochs=100, 
    imgsz=640, 
    batch=16
) 



# Prediction 

-- for test images
from ultralytics import YOLO 

model = YOLO("runs/segment/train/weights/best.pt") 
results = model.predict("test_images/example.jpg") 
results[0].show() 

-- folder of images

results = model.predict("test_images/*")
for r in results: 
  r.save() 

-- output is saved in runs/predict/
